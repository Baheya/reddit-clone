A reddit clone built using React, GraphQL, and Typescript, following Ben Awad's 14-hour long incredible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8">tutorial<a/>.
Includes the follow technologies:

- React

The backend is deployed on DigitalOcean using Dokku, and the frontend is hosted on Vercel but can be found on my portfolio website, blog.baheya.dev.

Currently working on getting cookies to work in deployment.
